# 🤖 ShaulNet - Robo-Shaul-TTS

## About the Robo-Shaul Challenge

The **Robo-Shaul Challenge** was a competition held from February to May 2023, aiming to develop the first open-source Hebrew text-to-speech (TTS) engine that replicates the voice of journalist and podcast host Shaul Amsterdamski. The initiative was documented in three podcast episodes, detailing the process and results.

As part of the challenge, a Hebrew single-speaker dataset named **SASPEECH** was created, consisting of approximately 30 hours of Amsterdamski's recordings. This dataset, along with a benchmark TTS system, was presented at INTERSPEECH 2023.

## ShaulNet

**ShaulNet** is our solution to the [Robo-Shaul Challenge](https://www.roboshaul.com/): a flexible, multilingual Text-to-Speech (TTS) system designed to synthesize natural-sounding Hebrew speech from raw text using a modular and configurable architecture.

Our solution requires the use of fully diacritized text in Hebrew.

This repository integrates and builds upon several outstanding open-source projects, including:

* [Matcha-TTS](https://github.com/shivammehta25/Matcha-TTS)
* [RingFormer](https://github.com/seongho608/RingFormer)
* [Tacotron2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2)
* [HiFi-GAN](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan)
* [BigVGAN](https://github.com/NVIDIA/BigVGAN)
* [Griffin-Lim](https://pytorch.org/audio/main/generated/torchaudio.transforms.GriffinLim.html)
* [WaveGlow](https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_waveglow/)
* [Distill-MOS](https://github.com/microsoft/Distill-MOS?tab=readme-ov-file)


## 🚀 Features

* 🎙️ High-quality text-to-speech synthesis
* 🌐 Full Hebrew language support, including diacritics and phonetic normalization
* 🧠 Built on state-of-the-art models and vocoders
* 🧪 Modular architecture for research, experimentation, and production


## 🔊 Audio Sample

Below is an example output generated by the ShaulNet system from Hebrew input text:

## 📝 Basic Usage

```bash
# Run TTS using the config file (choose model/vocoder inside it)
python inference.py --text "שָׁלוֹם עוֹלָם" --model matcha --vocoder hifigan --checkpoint checkpoints/matcha_tts/logs/train/ljspeech/runs/2025-06-02_14-11-39/checkpoints/checkpoint_epoch=2679.ckpt   --output-file outputs/generated.wav

````

Edit the `conf/config.yaml` file to customize the input text, model, vocoder, and output:

```yaml
inference:
  text: "מה קורה, שאול?"
  output_path: "outputs/shaul.wav"
```
